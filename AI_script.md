Bilal: I have the following code:

```r
plot1 <- ggplot(data = region_temporal, aes(x = Quarter, y = Trips)) +
  geom_line(color = "steelblue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", color = "red", linetype = "dotted") +
  labs(title = "Time Series Plot of Trips",
       x = "Quarter",
       y = "Trips (in thousands") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(scale = 1e-3)) +
  theme_minimal()

plot1 <- ggplotly(plot1)

plot1

```
Can I make the line look even better?

AI: Certainly, you can improve the appearance of the line in your ggplot2 plot. Here are some ways to make it look better:

Line Type: You can change the line type using the linetype argument in geom_line(). For example, you can use linetype = "dashed" to create a dashed line.

```r
ggplot(data = region_temporal, aes(x = Quarter, y = Trips)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue", linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(title = "Time Series Plot of Trips",
       x = "Quarter",
       y = "Trips") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(scale = 1e-3)) +
  theme_minimal()


```

Line Size: You can control the thickness of the line using the size argument. A larger value for size makes the line thicker.

```r
ggplot(data = region_temporal, aes(x = Quarter, y = Trips)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue", size = 1.5) +
  labs(title = "Time Series Plot of Trips",
       x = "Quarter",
       y = "Trips") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(scale = 1e-3)) +
  theme_minimal()

```

Smooth Line: You can make the line smoother using the geom_smooth() function. This adds a smoothed line to your plot.

```r
ggplot(data = region_temporal, aes(x = Quarter, y = Trips)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue", size = 1) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", color = "red", linetype = "dotted") +
  labs(title = "Time Series Plot of Trips",
       x = "Quarter",
       y = "Trips") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(scale = 1e-3)) +
  theme_minimal()

```

Feel free to experiment with these options to customize the appearance of your line plot to your liking.
