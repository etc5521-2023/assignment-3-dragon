Bilal: I have the following code:

```r
plot1 <- ggplot(data = region_temporal, aes(x = Quarter, y = Trips)) +
  geom_line(color = "steelblue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", color = "red", linetype = "dotted") +
  labs(title = "Time Series Plot of Trips",
       x = "Quarter",
       y = "Trips (in thousands") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(scale = 1e-3)) +
  theme_minimal()

plot1 <- ggplotly(plot1)

plot1

```
Can I make the line look even better?

AI: Certainly, you can improve the appearance of the line in your ggplot2 plot. Here are some ways to make it look better:

Line Type: You can change the line type using the linetype argument in geom_line(). For example, you can use linetype = "dashed" to create a dashed line.

```r
ggplot(data = region_temporal, aes(x = Quarter, y = Trips)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue", linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(title = "Time Series Plot of Trips",
       x = "Quarter",
       y = "Trips") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(scale = 1e-3)) +
  theme_minimal()


```

Line Size: You can control the thickness of the line using the size argument. A larger value for size makes the line thicker.

```r
ggplot(data = region_temporal, aes(x = Quarter, y = Trips)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue", size = 1.5) +
  labs(title = "Time Series Plot of Trips",
       x = "Quarter",
       y = "Trips") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(scale = 1e-3)) +
  theme_minimal()

```

Smooth Line: You can make the line smoother using the geom_smooth() function. This adds a smoothed line to your plot.

```r
ggplot(data = region_temporal, aes(x = Quarter, y = Trips)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue", size = 1) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", color = "red", linetype = "dotted") +
  labs(title = "Time Series Plot of Trips",
       x = "Quarter",
       y = "Trips") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(scale = 1e-3)) +
  theme_minimal()

```

Feel free to experiment with these options to customize the appearance of your line plot to your liking.

Hardik : Here is a custom theme function that can be applied to make the plots more appealing , how to add background : 

```r

custom_theme <- function() {
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, hjust = 0.5),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
    legend.title = element_text(size = 12),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 10),
    
  )
}

```

AI : here the output that can help :

```r

# Adding custom theme for all the plots
custom_theme <- function() {
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, hjust = 0.5),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
    legend.title = element_text(size = 12),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 10),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "lightgray"),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
  )
}
```

Hardik : what all can be included in ecotourism analysis :

AI: 

Ecotourism analysis can encompass a wide range of factors and considerations. It typically aims to assess the impact and sustainability of tourism activities on natural environments, local communities, and cultural heritage. Here are some key elements and aspects that can be included in an ecotourism analysis:

Environmental Impact Assessment:

Evaluate the impact of tourism activities on local ecosystems, including wildlife, vegetation, and water bodies.
Assess the effectiveness of conservation efforts and management practices.

Monitoring and Reporting:

Establish a system for ongoing monitoring, data collection, and reporting to track changes and improvements in ecotourism efforts.

Economic and Environmental Trade-offs:

Consider trade-offs between economic benefits and environmental costs, aiming for a balance that ensures long-term sustainability.
